House Price Prediction with MLOps Integration
Welcome to the House Price Prediction with MLOps Integration project! This project is designed to help you explore the power of data science, machine learning, and MLOps tools, including ZenML and MLflow, to build and deploy predictive models. Below, you‚Äôll find a comprehensive walkthrough of how we approach the problem, combining advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA), robust feature engineering, model validation, and MLOps best practices.

‚ú® Key Highlights
Comprehensive EDA: We dive deep into the dataset, uncovering valuable insights and trends that help shape the narrative of the data.
Feature Engineering: Carefully crafted features with a strong understanding of their impact on model performance, ensuring we only feed the most valuable data to our models.
Single Model Implementation: A streamlined yet powerful model, rigorously tested and validated for optimal performance. We focus on model precision, reliability, and scalability.
Scalable & Readable Code: Code written with clean architecture, leveraging design patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Template to ensure maintainability and extensibility.
MLOps Integration: Using ZenML and MLflow for seamless experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment, ensuring the entire pipeline is automated, transparent, and reproducible.
üöÄ Features
Data Analysis: In-depth visualization and analysis to identify key features that influence house pricing.
Automated Model Training & Evaluation: Once the data is cleaned and pre-processed, the model training process is automated with an emphasis on hyperparameter tuning and performance validation.
End-to-End Pipeline: Integration of MLOps tools like ZenML and MLflow for managing experiments and deploying models, ensuring reproducibility and smooth transitions from development to production.
Documentation & Code Readability: Clean and organized code, following the best practices in software engineering, making it easier for anyone to understand and contribute.
üîß Technologies Used
Python: Core language for building the models, scripts, and workflows.
ZenML: To automate the pipeline and integrate MLOps for seamless tracking and model management.
MLflow: To track experiments, store models, and keep a record of training parameters and metrics.
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
